I implemented and validated the tensile design logic for bolted tension members as per IS 800:2007, including gross section yielding, net section rupture, and block shear failure. I developed unit and integration tests using PyTest to ensure correct identification of the governing failure mode and robust handling of edge cases and invalid inputs.
